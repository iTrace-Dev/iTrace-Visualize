# iTrace-Visualize
Data visualization application for the iTrace Infrastructure.

iTrace-Visualize requires input in the form of a SQLite database generated from iTrace-Toolkit, as well as a video generated from iTrace-ScreenRecord and OBS.

To run iTrace-Visualize, make sure a recent version of Python 3 is installed, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies. `Visualization.py` is the main script.
